If you get an error telling you that you can't use the program as the version isn't approved, please get an older (more stable) version from http://wp.southportbeekeepers.co.uk/NPWatcherA.zip

Note that this is a testing release, as, due to internet problems, I've been unable to fully test the changes.  They should improve the ever-annoying user name handling, and get it to work in all occurences.  Please, as ever, check your contributions for problems when using automated editing tools - namely make usre that there aren't any big problems with name of the pages that the warnings are left on.  Hopefully all should work well.

If there's a problem, please make a note of it at [[User_talk:Maretinp23]]  and [[User_talk:Martinp23/NPWatcher]], and if it hasn't already been done, ask an admin to remove this version (0.8.5.8) from the versions checkpage, which can be found from the main approvals page.

Thanks.
